Single-cell data provided. Please ensure that a column termed cell_type is included in obs of AnnData.
If bulk data path was provided, it will be overwritten by the pseudobulk simulation.
No cell type proportions provided. New proportions will be simulated.
Specified sc_layer X not in scRNA-seq data object. Using default layer.
Using default layer for pseudobulk simulation.
Generating cell fractions using Dirichlet distribution without prior info (actually random).
Random cell fractions are generated.
You set sparse as True, some cell's fraction will be zero, the probability is 0.2
Selected rare, thus some cell type fractions are very small (<3%), this celltype is randomly chosen by percentage you set before.
Sampling cells to compose pseudo-bulk data...
Sampling is done.
Returning raw summed counts in pseudobulks.
Writing pseudobulks to output.
Bulk data provided.
